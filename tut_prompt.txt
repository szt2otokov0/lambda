I need you to create a C++ tutorial for me. I have previous knowledge of programming basics, object-oriented programming in C#. Try to focus one C++'s more unique features that may be new for someone only familiar with C#.

There are some topics I already know about, such as:
- pointers
- templates
- smart pointer and RAII
- vectors
- STL
- lambda expressions and functional programming
- file reading and writing
- <INSERT MORE KNOWLEDGE HERE>
I already know how the above work, so you shouldn't talk about them.

The structure of the tutorial is as follows:
- Break it down to chapters which tell me about one topic at a time. One chapter should fit in one response and one response must only have one chapter.
- I might ask you questions between chapters, so only show the next chapter when I specifically ask you to.
- One chapter should have a title, a short introduction, some more detailed explanation of the topic and some examples at the end which shows the chapters' subject used in practice.
